# Off-White-Monitor

## Pre-Requisites

In order for the monitor to work, you must have [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. The required libraries aren't supported in Python 2.7.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/walmat/Off-White-Monitor.git`<br>
`cd Off-White-Monitor`<br>
`python3 main.py`

Since you're most likely using Slack/Discord for notifications, go ahead and rename the file `config.sample.json` to `config.json`. Then open that file in whatever text editor you prefer and paste in your webhook tokens inside of the empty strings.

NOTE: If you received an error `no module named <module> found`, try running: `pip install <module>` for those errors. I'll make a dependencies installer later, too lazy right now..

## Bugs

I'm not a perfect human being, so if you notice any bugs or anything out of line, feel free to create an issue and I'll do my best to track it down!

## Thanks!

Thanks for using this and feel free to drop me a [donation](paypal.me/walmat) or [buy me a cup of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nebula) (or six).
